# FlashMe - Server

### Server

This is the Spring Boot server system we created to act as our SQL database management app. With Spring, Tomcat, and Derby we've built out a robust data management system to offer realtime updates to the deck and card creation, and user profile updates. Information stored on the server can be shared in the future to a web app to allow syncronized accounts across all platforms of _Flash Me_.
